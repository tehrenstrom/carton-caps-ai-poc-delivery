                <h2>Why This Matters Now More Than Ever</h2>
                <p>Across the United States, public schools face staggering annual funding gaps that top $80 billion. This shortfall translates directly to fewer resources: canceled field trips, outdated textbooks, and diminished arts or STEM programs. These are precisely the experiences that spark curiosity and can change youth life trajectories.</p>
                <p>Carton Caps offers a vital solution by turning everyday shopping into a steady revenue stream for classrooms. Capper, your new AI assistant, amplifies this impact by removing friction and making it easier than ever for customers to support schools through their purchases with margins much greater than traditional fundraising efforts.</p>
                <p>Every interaction, every purchase facilitated by Capper, directs real dollars toward essential supplies. Together with Capper, we'll put pencils, meals, musical instruments, and more, into students' hands, helping to close critical opportunity gaps.</p>

                <h2>Why Capper?</h2>
                <p>Recent e-commerce research shows that <strong>LLM‑powered chat increases repeat engagement 18‑32%</strong> and drives <strong>up to 20% higher conversion</strong> when paired with personalised recommendations. By embedding Capper directly in the Carton Caps app we tap the same levers with speed, clarity and personalization. Our goal is to turn one‑time shoppers into loyal school supporters that revolutionize the way schools are supported.</p>

                <p>Carton Caps has already proven successful at converting everyday purchases into meaningful support for schools. Capper enhances this mission by:</p>

                <h2>User Experience</h2>
                <p>70% of Gen Z shoppers prefer chat over menus. Capper meets them where they are, allowing users to:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ask</strong> questions in natural language about products (e.g., "What breakfast items do you have?") or the referral program (e.g., "How do I refer a friend?").</li>
                    <li><strong>Receive</strong> relevant product suggestions or clear explanations of referral rules and FAQs based on the available knowledge base.</li>
                    <li><strong>Get recommendations</strong> based on criteria like price (e.g., "I have $25 and I'm looking for a hearty meal, which product do you suggest I purchase?").</li>
                    <li><strong>Explore</strong> product details and referral information through fluid, multi‑turn conversations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Capper uses the active customer profile and all of their connected persona data and conversation history to provide contextually relevant responses and recommendations.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Evaluate Current POC:</strong> Conduct basic internal user tests and initial performance benchmarks on the existing prototype.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gather User Feedback:</strong> Run moderated customer testing sessions to assess usability, capture task-completion times, and measure sentiment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prioritize Roadmap & Design:</strong> Conduct a sprint planning session with Product and Engineering to refine and prioritize roadmap items (like in-chat referrals, vector search, personalization) based on POC findings and user feedback. Define clear success metrics for the next phase.</li>
                    <li><strong>Production Readiness - Technology:</strong> Plan and implement core technical enhancements for scalability and reliability:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Replace basic knowledge retrieval with a Vector Database (RAG) implementation.</li>
